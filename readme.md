# Gender-Based Voice Recognition System

## Overview

This Gender-Based Voice Recognition System is a Python-based project implemented in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The system utilizes the VoxCeleb dataset for training and predicting the likely gender of the speaker using machine learning techniques.

## Features

- **Audio Input**: Accepts audio files in various formats (e.g., WAV, MP3) as input for gender prediction.
  
- **Preprocessing**: Includes audio preprocessing steps to extract relevant features from the input audio files.

- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a trained machine learning model (trained on the VoxCeleb dataset) to predict gender based on the extracted features.

- **Jupyter Notebook**: The system is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, providing an interactive and easy-to-follow environment for users.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajeibi/gender-voice-recognition.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd gender-voice-recognition
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `voiceRecog.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.

2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the different cells and analyze your voice data.

3. Download and upload your VoxCeleb dataset audio file(s) as directed in the notebook. https://github.com/hechmik/voxceleb_enrichment_age_gender/blob/main/dataset/final_dataframe_extended.csv

4. Run the cells to preprocess the audio, load the trained model, and make predictions.

5. View the results and predictions generated by the model.

## Model Training (Optional)

If you want to train the gender recognition model using your own VoxCeleb dataset:

1. Download the VoxCeleb dataset and prepare labeled audio samples (male/female).

2. Modify the notebook to include your dataset and retrain the model.

3. Save the trained model for future predictions.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)
